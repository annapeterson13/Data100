# How does Owen Barder define development? How does he extend Amartya Sen’s definition to include the idea of complexity?

	Barder defines development as an emergent property of the economic and social system. He begins by saying that most people think of development as an improvement in people’s well being, and argues that it is much much more than that. Barder compares development to a part of a brain or a cloud in a thunderstorm; it’s one part of a complex system of action. He extends Sen’s definition by arguing that development conveys something about the ability of economic, political, and social systems to provide for their population and establish well-being and most importantly, opportunity. He specifies that this must be done a long term, sustainable amount of time.

# What was the toaster project? What did Thomas Thwaites attempt to do? Was he successful? What is the significance of this example in the context of complexity?

	Thomas Thwaites attempted to build and create his own toaster from scratch. He did this by purchasing the cheapest toaster he could find (about 6 us dollars) and took it apart. From this, he discovered that even the simplest cheapest toaster out there was made out of a very complex system of parts. He created a **version of** his own toaster by a series of unconventional steps including microwaving plastic to melt it. Once it was finished, he tested it out and it immediately exploded after it began working. The significance of this was that complexity is everywhere. In any system of any sort there are many different parts with unique functions that effect and complement each other, much like an economy. An economy consists of many different people, institutions, and products that interact and depend on each other, much like a toaster’s buttons and wires.

# According to Barder how successful have economic models been at describing and predicting growth over the past 50 years?

	Barder spends time listing off theories and ideas from different significant economic and political figures from various countries, and after each explanation he concludes that they are wrong--they in fact do not predict growth. These theories and ideas included policy changes/differences, political changes/differences, and more. Barder suggests that to conclude anything about development and growth we must experiment like there is no tomorrow. Experimenting will lead to establishing the significance of certain variables in an economy and rule out the less significant factors. He believes that true development and success comes from a constantly self-adapting and evolving environment, and therefore we must create an environment that is conductive for that.

# Who was Steve Jones? What did he do at Uni-Lever? Was he successful? How significant were his results?
	Steve Jones worked for Unilever, a laundry detergent company that was having  problems with their nozzle as it was clogging very easily. Jones took this and used a long process of experimentation to maximize the functionality of a new nozzle. He did this by randomly generating a large number of them and testing the functionality of each. Once he found the most efficient one, he did the same process with that one (randomly generated a large number of versions of it). He repeated this until he reached the maximum functioning version, resulting in success and very significant results as his mathematical and experimental method proved where experimentation and mathematics can take us during creation.

# What is a complex adaptive system? What are some of its important features?

	A complex adaptive system is, in the most common sense, biological or physical. For example a storm such as a hurricane is a complex adaptive system as it consists of many different complex factors that interact with each other and change themselves as their environment changes. Barder states that complex adaptive systems are non-linear, however this is about as specific as “asking where the non-elephants are at the zoo”. Complex Adaptive Systems have many dynamic properties in their many different parts. We can use mathematics to study them and build theories about them.

# Who was Haile Sellasie?  According to Barder (and Kapuscinski), how did Ethiopia during the time of The Emporer exemplify the suppression of emergent systemic change?

	Haile Sellasie was the emperor of Ethiopia in the 1900’s until it was overthrown. Barder describe Sellasie’s unique ways of governing through Kapuscinski’s book, which included secret police reporting to him as he fed lions around his palace, the hour of assignments, and the hour of the cash box, when a servant was chosen to carry the emperor’s lambskin purse and polish the shoes of visitors. All decisions and questions came from Sellasie, and it was dangerous to notify him of any poverty in Ethiopia. Barder states that what we can learn from regimes like this is that their internal logic was to extract any economic value from their population and suppress any efforts that suggest moving towards an inclusive society that threatens a leader’s position. This halts any emergent systemic change because it leaves no room for natural development as everything is controlled by one person, allowing no adaption or change.

# Why does Barder recommend resisting engineering as a policy implication? What did he mean by iso-morphic mimicry?

	Barder recommends resisting engineering because he believes that things have been and will be much more successful through natural evolution, development, and adaption than they will be through formulation and creation. A strict design can limit a society rather than improve it, as there is little room for complexity and natural improvement as it (a thing, society, person, etc.) responds to its surroundings. Iso-morphic mimicry is a way of defining the method of using a model of something that works, in this case an economy or society, and recreating it. With this method, no one should expect success as it does not account for the circumstances of the time and place.

# What does Barder mean by "resist fatalism"? Who was Norman Borlaug and what is the green revolution?

	Resist fatalism is a way of defining the idea that although we should stray away from mimicry and design, we shouldn’t leave everything up to nature and fate either. In order to accelerate and shape the process of development and evolution we must make careful, thought-out decisions and intervene strategically with our environment. Norman Borlaug was an agronomist who led the Green Revolution, a period of time when a series of worldwide initiatives increased agricultural production, relieving a lot of hunger. He initiated a change in action which resulted in adaptation and success.
