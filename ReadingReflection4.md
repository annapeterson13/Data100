Provide three examples from Geoff West’s reading that illustrate how scale can be used to more fully understand human development as a complex and adapting social and economic system.  Additionally, what did Geoff West have to say about the use of theory and big data?  According to West, can a theory be relevant in the face of big data?  Please provide an example.

First, cities are an example Geoff West uses to illustrate how scale can be used to more fully understand human development as a complex and adapting social and economic system. Cities are networks of roads, highways, power lines, and street signs. They develop overtime in order to maximize efficiency and population. A city is a balance of interaction, income, and the crime that comes with it all. Scale is demonstrated through cities as populations naturally gather towards cities, a hub, or nucleus, of civilization. Through this population we see opportunities for data as we study trends like how often civilians go somewhere based on how far they live from it. West compares a city to an airport hub-and-spoke system which has one central location and a few main branched-off locations that are connected. 

West also uses companies as an example of scale. We can use companies to demonstrate human development as we study their half-life and success. As we gather statistics on how long they were successful and how long it took them to die, we can conclude ideas that explain how profit increases and decreases as new protocols and regulations are added. We can also study diversification and innovation through companies just as we study the scaling of it in the general sense of human development.

Lastly, West uses social interaction and networks as an example of scale. He asked the question “How many close friends do you really have?” and discusses the evolutionary psychologist Robin Dunbar’s ideas and data. He described using mathematical structure to study what strengthens and weakens a relationship, such as appearance and proximity. Social Networks are a clear comparison to using scale for human development as our own social networks develop and change overtime because of changes in values and increased connections to different categories of people in different places.

Geoff West ultimately concludes that Big Data needs a Big Theory to go with it. He describes that the Data Revolution has allowed us to study complex systems more efficiently, but if we study Big Data without specific questions and theories to guide us the data becomes too broad and somewhat irrelevant. The relationship between theory is crucial as theory drives all data, and data somewhat drives theory as well. The two of them complement each other and make each other relevant. 
For example, in an increasingly technological world it’s important to ask questions like how the development of cell phones affected the development of human connection throughout different locations. Using a variable like technology, or more specifically cell phones, we can use data to make a complex system seem less complex and more connected throughout. Without specific questions and variables like these we have no theory, and therefore our data is less accounted for and relevant.
