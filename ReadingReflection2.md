In Rob Kitchen’s “Big Data, New Epistemologies, and Paradigm Shifts”, he describes the concept of “Big Data” and its strength and its strength and implications in a world of knowledge and wonder. The main premise of Kitchen’s  argument for Big Data is how we can use it for and apply it to analysis of social and scientific phenomenon. The idea here is that we have so many ideas and theories that have been formed and developed overtime, but through the first three “paradigms of science”  rather than the fourth that he is suggesting (Data Intensive, Exploratory Science). Because of this, a lot of our knowledge has been based on observation, and eventually based on some computation, but nothing that would compare to the numbers we could apply with Big Data. Adding numbers to something makes it quantitative rather than qualitative, and consequently based on more fact than opinion.
Measurement in general can completely change a scientific study or experiment (as I described, it goes from qualitative to quantitative). Specifically in Psychology, I’ve experienced many instances where one must make a variable measurable by assigning numbers to different levels of it. For example, if one was to study happiness in five year old boys versus girls in a classroom, there would need to put an objective spin on the word happiness, maybe by counting the number of times they smiled during the observation. This makes the scientific study much more valuable as we can apply statistical analyses to it, only beginning with conducting hypothesis tests.
This is where Big Data comes in, as measurable information that can transform a study, not only by making it go from subjective to objective but it allows the study to more accurately be applied to a whole population, and how it develops overtime. Big Data is concrete, numerical information that can study variability in populations to be further evaluated and analyzed.
Data Science will increase our understanding of populations through their economy and culture as they are constantly changing and increasing in complexity. As stated previously, with Data Science we can more accurately apply studies to an entire area and population, which creates a much more powerful basis of knowledge for argument and presentation. Data Science can also follow how variability in population is a moving target at all times.
Chris Anderson said,“It’s time to ask, ‘What can Science learn from Google?’” and I think this is a perfectly simplistic way of describing how the Data Deluge (essentially, the overflowing amount of data we have on people that becomes too much for proper evaluation) is actually a helpful and innovating thing as our lifestyles develop into such technology-based actions through computers and phones. Google contains extensive global data consisting of search histories, clicked links, and more. We can use this to study populations in a much more in depth manner.
